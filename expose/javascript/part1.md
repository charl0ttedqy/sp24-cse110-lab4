4. There is an error because "result" is declared using the let keyword, which means that it cannot be accessed outside the block it is defined in.\

5. There is an error at line 7 since we are trying to reassign a value to "result" which was declared using the keyword const. This prevents line 9 from being executed.\
6. No printed output. The variable "result" is declared inside the if block, so it cannot be reached from outside the block, also since it was declared using the const keyword, there will also be issues when we try to reassign value to it.
